A Virtual Operations Command Center is a secure, cloud-based hub that allows you to monitor, control, and optimize infrastructure, utility, and building operations from a central console. Data from sensors and devices provide a real-time view of performance. 
We are currently leading research to develop a comprehensive end-to-end Virtual Operations Command Center and need real cases to help us test and pilot this technology. As a pilot project participant, we will work with you to develop an Operations Center that meets your specific needs. 
We can tackle any kind of project, of any size! All you need is an existing source of streaming operational data—whether that is from SCADA systems, IoT devices or field crews.
Possible projects include:
You could attempt to develop a custom operations center on your own, but as a pilot project participant, you’ll get a head start by building on technology we’ve already developed. You will also have access to our research team and potential research funding opportunities.
Most importantly, you will have a say in key features of the product and be up and running on the market before your competitors.
Complete our form and a member of our R&D team will be in touch. We’ll set up a time to discuss your project and potential opportunities for participation.
